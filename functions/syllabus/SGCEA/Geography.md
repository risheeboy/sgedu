Syllabus Information:
Here's a structured representation of the H2 Geography syllabus information for a genAI model:

**I. Core Content:**

* **Theme 1: Coasts and Coastal Management**
    * **Topic 1.1 Coastal Processes and Landforms:**
        * Processes: Wave action (erosion, transportation, deposition), tides, currents, sea-level changes.
        * Landforms: Cliffs, platforms, beaches, spits, bars, dunes, coral reefs, mangroves.
    * **Topic 1.2 Coastal Hazards and Risks:**
        * Hazards: Coastal erosion, storm surges, tsunamis, sea-level rise.
        * Factors influencing risk: Human activities, natural factors, coastal defense structures.
    * **Topic 1.3 Coastal Management Strategies:**
        * Hard engineering: Seawalls, groynes, breakwaters.
        * Soft engineering: Beach nourishment, dune stabilization, managed retreat.
        * Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM).

* **Theme 2: Development and Sustainability**
    * **Topic 2.1 Defining Development:**
        * Concepts: Economic development, social development, sustainable development.
        * Indicators: GDP, HDI, GINI coefficient, ecological footprint.
    * **Topic 2.2 Factors Affecting Development:**
        * Physical factors: Resource availability, climate, natural hazards.
        * Human factors: Political stability, education, infrastructure, technology, globalisation.
    * **Topic 2.3 Managing Development Challenges:**
        * Strategies: Trade, aid, debt relief, investment, technology transfer, microfinance.
        * Challenges: Inequality, environmental degradation, climate change, resource depletion.

* **Theme 3: Global Climate Change**
    * **Topic 3.1 The Science of Climate Change:**
        * Evidence: Temperature records, sea-level rise, ice melt, extreme weather events.
        * Causes: Greenhouse effect, human activities, natural factors.
    * **Topic 3.2 Impacts of Climate Change:**
        * Physical impacts: Sea-level rise, extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, biodiversity loss.
        * Human impacts: Displacement, food security, water scarcity, health impacts, economic impacts.
    * **Topic 3.3 Mitigation and Adaptation:**
        * Mitigation: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transport, carbon capture.
        * Adaptation: Adjusting to the impacts of climate change through infrastructure development, water management, disaster preparedness, ecosystem restoration.


**II. Geographical Skills and Investigation**

* **Geographical Data Collection and Analysis:**
    * Primary data collection: Fieldwork techniques (observation, measurement, surveys, interviews).
    * Secondary data sources: Maps, satellite imagery, statistical data, reports.
    * Data analysis: Statistical techniques, graphical representation, cartographic techniques.

* **Geographical Inquiry and Problem Solving:**
    * Formulating research questions.
    * Hypothesis testing.
    * Report writing.



**III. Assessment (Specifics from the 2023 syllabus):**

* **Paper 1: Essay Questions (2 hours 30 minutes)**
    * Source-based case study: 60 marks.
    * Essay questions on Themes 1 and 2: 40 marks each (choose one).
* **Paper 2: Essay Questions (1 hour 30 minutes)**
    * Essay questions on Theme 3: 50 marks.
* **Paper 3: Geographical Investigation (1 hour 30 minutes)**
    * Independent investigation report: 75 marks.
* **Paper 4: Fieldwork (flexible timing)**
    * Fieldwork report: 25 marks.

**Key Features of the Syllabus Useful for GenAI Question Generation:**

* **Emphasis on understanding concepts:** Questions should focus on applying concepts rather than just recalling facts.
* **Interconnections between themes:**  Questions can explore links between different themes, like the impact of climate change on coastal areas or development.
* **Real-world examples and case studies:**  Questions should incorporate relevant examples and case studies to demonstrate application of knowledge.
* **Data interpretation and analysis:** Questions can involve interpreting maps, graphs, and statistical data.
* **Evaluation and decision-making:**  Questions can ask students to evaluate different management strategies and propose solutions to geographical challenges.
* **Sustainability:** The concept of sustainability is central to the syllabus and should be integrated into questions related to development, resource management, and climate change.


This detailed breakdown of the H2 Geography syllabus should empower the genAI model to generate effective questions and answers that align with the curriculum's objectives. Note that this information pertains to the 2023 syllabus.  Future syllabus revisions may necessitate adjustments.
