Students learn to evaluate definite integrals, find the area of regions bounded by curves and lines, and calculate volumes of revolution.  Finding the area and volume of revolution for curves defined parametrically is excluded.    
- Differential Equations: This section focuses on solving first-order differential equations of the form dx/dy=f(x)g(y), including using substitution.  Students learn to formulate and interpret differential equations in the context of real-world problems.

## 7. Probability and Statistics
- Probability: This section covers the addition and multiplication principles for counting, permutations, combinations, and arrangements of objects.  Students learn about probability laws, mutually exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability.  Using various tools like tables, Venn diagrams, and tree diagrams to calculate probabilities is also emphasized.    
- Discrete Random Variables: This section introduces discrete random variables, probability distributions, expectation, and variance.  The binomial distribution B(n, p) is used as a model, and students learn about its properties and conditions under which it is a suitable model.  Finding the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable is excluded.    
- Normal Distribution: This section covers continuous random variables and the normal distribution as a continuous probability model.  Students learn about the standard normal distribution, finding probabilities, and the properties of the normal curve.  Solving problems involving E(aX+b), Var(aX+b), E(aX+bY), and Var(aX+bY) where X and Y are independent is also included.  The normal approximation to the binomial distribution is excluded.    
- Sampling: This section introduces the concepts of population and simple random sample.  Students learn about the sample mean as a random variable and its distribution, the Central Limit Theorem, and unbiased estimates of population mean and variance.    
- Hypothesis Testing: This section covers the concepts of null and alternative hypotheses, test statistic, critical region, level of significance, and p-value.  Students learn to formulate hypotheses and conduct hypothesis testing for a population mean using samples from normal populations or large samples.  One-tail and two-tail tests are included, while Type I and Type II errors and testing the difference between two population means are excluded.    
- Correlation and Linear Regression: This section covers using scatter diagrams to assess linear relationships, the correlation coefficient, and linear regression using the method of least squares. 

 Students learn about interpolation, extrapolation, and using transformations to achieve linearity.  Deriving formulae, the relationship between the correlation coefficient and regression coefficients, and hypothesis tests are excluded.
