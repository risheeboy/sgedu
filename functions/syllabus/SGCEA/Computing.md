H2 Computing Syllabus Information for GenAI Model

Here's a structured representation of the H2 Computing syllabus information, extracted from the provided sources and supplemented with general knowledge, designed to aid a GenAI model in generating relevant questions and answers:

**I. Main Topics Covered:**

* **Algorithms and Data Structures:**  This section delves into the design and analysis of algorithms, covering various searching and sorting techniques, and their efficiency using Big O notation.  It also explores different data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees.
* **Programming:**  This focuses on practical programming skills, including object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, recursion, and the use of Python 3 as the primary language.
* **Data and Information:** This covers data representation in various number bases, relational and non-relational databases (like SQLite and MongoDB), and the ethical and societal implications of computing, including data privacy and relevant laws.
* **Computer Networks:**  This section introduces network fundamentals, including the TCP/IP model, DNS, client-server architecture, web applications (using HTML and CSS), and basic network security concepts.

**II. In-depth Information about Each Topic and Subtopic:**

* **A. Algorithms and Data Structures:**
    * **Searching Algorithms:** Linear search, binary search, and their time complexities.
    * **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, and their efficiencies.
    * **Big O Notation:**  Analyzing algorithm efficiency in terms of time and space complexity (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)).
    * **Data Structures:**
        * **Linked Lists:** Singly and doubly linked lists, operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
        * **Stacks:**  LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure, operations like push and pop.
        * **Queues:** FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure, operations like enqueue and dequeue.
        * **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):**  Tree structure with specific ordering properties, operations like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

* **B. Programming:**
    * **Python 3:** Syntax, data types, control structures, functions, modules, and libraries.
    * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
    * **Recursion:**  Functions that call themselves, base cases, and recursive steps.
    * **File Handling:** Reading and writing data to files.
    * **Exception Handling:**  Managing errors and unexpected situations during program execution.

* **C. Data and Information:**
    * **Number Bases:**  Binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and conversions between them.
    * **Data Representation:**  Different ways of representing data (e.g., ASCII, Unicode).
    * **Databases:**
        * **Relational Databases (SQLite):** Tables, SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), relationships between tables.
        * **Non-Relational Databases (MongoDB):**  Document-based data storage, JSON format.
    * **Ethics and Impacts of Computing:**  Privacy concerns, data security, intellectual property, and the social impact of technology.
    * **Data Protection Laws:**  General awareness of regulations related to data privacy and security.

* **D. Computer Networks:**
    * **Network Fundamentals:** Network topologies, protocols, and communication models.
    * **TCP/IP Model:** Layers of the TCP/IP model and their functions.
    * **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translating domain names to IP addresses.
    * **Client-Server Architecture:**  How clients and servers interact in a network.
    * **Web Applications:**
        * **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**  Creating web page structure and content.
        * **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**  Styling web pages.
    * **Network Security:** Basic concepts like firewalls, encryption, and authentication.


**III. Marking Rubrics (General, as specific rubrics are not available):**

Assessment typically involves written papers and practical exams.  Marking schemes generally assess the following:

* **Knowledge and Understanding:**  Demonstrating comprehension of core concepts and principles.
* **Application and Analysis:** Applying knowledge to solve problems, analyze scenarios, and design solutions.
* **Evaluation and Synthesis:**  Critically evaluating different approaches, and synthesizing information to form conclusions.
* **Practical Skills:**  Demonstrating proficiency in programming, database operations, and other practical tasks.
* **Communication and Presentation:**  Clearly and effectively communicating ideas and solutions.
