Syllabus Information:
Here's a structured overview of the H1, H2, and H3 Literature in English syllabus based on the provided source and my knowledge, focusing on the 2017 Singapore-Cambridge A-Level syllabus:

**I. General Overview**

The syllabus emphasizes close reading, critical thinking, and contextual understanding of literary texts.  Students are expected to analyze stylistic features, understand the contexts surrounding the texts' creation, and relate the texts to their own experiences.  This involves engaging with literature at both cognitive and affective levels.

**II.  Areas of Study & Assessment Objectives**

While the syllabus doesn't rigidly compartmentalize learning, it broadly covers these areas:

* **Literary Analysis:**  Understanding literary devices, form, structure, and language.
* **Contextual Understanding:**  Considering the historical, social, and cultural influences on texts.
* **Personal Response:**  Developing informed personal interpretations and critical judgments.
* **Comparison and Evaluation:** Comparing different texts and critical perspectives.
* **Research and Presentation (H3):** Conducting independent research, forming arguments, and presenting findings academically.

**III. Syllabus Structure (H1, H2, H3)**

* **H1 Literature in English:** Focuses on developing fundamental literary analysis skills.  Students study selected texts and learn to analyze unseen passages.  Assessment is typically through a single, open-book examination.

* **H2 Literature in English:** Expands on H1, requiring more in-depth analysis and the ability to compare texts. Typically involves Paper 1 (Unseen and Set Texts across genres) and Paper 3 (Postcolonial Literature) and another paper for a specific period study.

* **H3 Literature in English:**  Caters to students with exceptional literary aptitude.  It involves independent research culminating in a 3000-3500 word essay and an 800-1200 word evaluative commentary. This research must focus on texts *not* studied in H1 or H2.

**IV.  Specific Topics & Subtopics**

The specific texts and topics vary based on the Junior College offering the course. However, the 2017 syllabus specifies the following for H2:

**A. Paper 1: Reading Literature**

    * Section A: Unseen Poetry (response and comparison).
    * Section B: Prose (set text essay and passage-based questions).
    * Section C: Drama (set text essay and passage-based questions).

**B. Paper 3: Postcolonial Literature**


C. Pre-20th Century Writing or other paper depending on the college offering.
